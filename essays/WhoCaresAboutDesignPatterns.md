## Pedagogy of Software Development

ICS 314: Software Engineering is a required course for Computer Science majors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The latter part of the course is analogous to taking an engine apart to learn how to make it. We saw videos of instructor writing the program by modifying  pre-existing codes. We repeated what we saw, modifying a pre-existing code exactly the same, from our memory. This method exploits the fact that "homan beings are pattern-forming machines", a quote by my first computer science professor. With so much remembering by doing, we could, potentially, find patterns and principles behind how a problem is solved.

## What is Real?

Having firsthand experience with a UI framework teaches us about professional-looking websites. That image of the Hawaii Travel Website is as reliable as a hand-scribbled note saying, "Heather is Covid Negative. She's clear to skip Quarantine. Thanks, Dr. Jones." Anyone can produce either. Before learning UI frameworks, I knew "theoretically" that anyone could write a nice webpage. But on an emotional level, I still trusted clean, sleek-looking websites. I would screenshot confirmation pages for records. I advised people to do the same before. Now I am not so sure.

## I Feel Old

I'm a 38-year-old returning college student. When I first went to college in 2004, I did not have a cellphone. I handwrote my college applications, then mailed them via FedEx. Over the years, I was impressed by how everything—job applications, school applications, taxes—shifted online. Learning a UI framework feels like another leap of technology to me. More technology will be easily available in the next decade. Perhaps I can make a movie of me doing a backflip. And if I can post myself doing it online, why bother to learn it in real life? Or would we evolve to distrust anything we see online?
