## Hello, Computer Science

Hotel front desk seems like an odd place to develop interest in computer science. However, that was the case for me. I was never passionate about the hospitality industry, but it paid my bills while I pursued my dream in professional dancing. The property management system was called LightSpeed, written in Java. Ironically, LightSpeed was much slower than its predecessor, Galaxy. Galaxy was my favorite part of the job- it worked so fast, probably thanks to its command line interface. And the command line interface made me feel...like I was doing something really smart (I wasn't). 

I also enjoyed the problem solving aspect of the job.  Chief among them was finding a different room for a guest who disliked their room. I'd later realize that this was a variation on the scheduling problem- our problem being 791 rooms consisting of 3 buildings, 23 room types, and some siginificat differences even within a room type. We would often have rooms with 1 King bed ocean view oversold, and have only ocean views with 2 double beds left. Honeymooners would check in and be distraught, but more often, furious. I've written a pseudocode for how I'd handle this situation:


Switch (How Mad Are They){

  case 1: They can live with it
    apologize;
    give drink coupons;
    break;

  case 2: They are furious
    apologize;
    look for rooms; 
      If (I can switch rooms with another reservation){
        switch these rooms;
      } else {
        if (there is a higher category room with 2 beds){
        sweet talk to them and see if they'll take a free upgrade but with 2 beds;
          if (Guest == happy){
            return;
          }else{
            look for an ocean view king bed opening up nextday;
              if (Guest != happy || no king bed for entire stay){
                look into transferring them to a sister hotel; //last option
              }
    break;
}

This is separate from the scheduling problem of finding a desired room. In 2015, I enrolled in KCC and took ICS 111 and 141, Introduction to Java Programming and Introduction to Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science. However, I didn't continue with it. 
    
  


## COVID 

Covid put a pause on both work and dancing. It gave me enough time to think and take the plunge of returning to school on a full time basis. 
## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
