*How Many Programmers are needed to Wallpaper an Entire Room?*

My favorite answer is, depends on how thinly you slice them. This is an example of lateral thinking. We assume programmers provie labor to wallpaper the room- not becoming the raw material to cover the wall. In Java when we write a function, a data type of each parameter is specified. But in Javascript, it's not. How does that affect the product? Could a program act in unexpected ways? And if it does, would it be chaos or something fresh and innovative?

## Convenience 

This code from freeCodeCamp is a function that simulates the casino game Black Jack.

let count = 0;

function cc(card) {

  switch (card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++;
      break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      count--;
      break;
  }
  if (count > 0) {
    return count + " Bet";
  } else {
    return count + " Hold";
  }

}

cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');

This code would be much harder to write if data types of parameters need to be set.  Converting "J" to a numerical value is easy, but how do we even get to that step? For example, if we were to specify cc (int card) like in Java, error will be thrown when cc(Q); is entered. It shows how Java does not operate like the human mind- it does not have a latitude of thinking that programmers could, theoretically, be used to wallpaper the entire room.
