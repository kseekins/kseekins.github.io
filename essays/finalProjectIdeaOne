## Procrastinator Tamagocchi: Facebook for your ominous tasks that feeds on your mental health

## Overview

This app will provide dark yet university friendly humor to users struggling with procrastination. It may or may not help with procrastination, I'm not a psychologist. Users will make an account, then "list" their procrastination tasks. These tasks will have several states and functions. 

Description : What are you procrastinating on 
Check boxes: Urgent-non urgent and Important-less important checkboxes
Category Areas: is it coursework? Paper work? Applications? Taxes? 
Choose an avatar for your procrastination: Regan MacNeil from exorcist , The Babadook, Samara Morgan, Darth Vader, Mrs. Sallie Mae. 
Deadlines and consequences section 

Other components of the app: 

Communal list of procrastination tasks 
Up vote (wow, that is a hot mess; you can vote that once a day); For 10 or more hot mess votes, your demon will enter the hall of fame. 
Throw a drink at your demon’s face (You can click this if you do something about it for 3 minutes; users will get reminders to at least “throw a drink” at your procrastination demons. )
Kill button: For that special moment when you get it done!!!
Parental Forums (Chat rooms) 
For $0.99/month pro version, you can see the list of prior procrastination demons you slayed. 
Help Me Page (advertisement section for therapists) 


## Use case ideas
This app will allow users to make profiles of the tasks that they are supposed to be doing. But, it will send reminders to tackle it ("DEBRA! It's time to THROW that drink on your 2022 taxes!!") Hopefully the chatroom will help procrastinators make friends with other procrastinators. They could even schedule a meet up or procrastinate that as well.
