## Not Bad for 2 Weeks of HTML Design and UI Framework 



## What is Real?

Having firsthand experience with a UI framework teaches us about professional-looking websites. That image of the Hawaii Travel Website is as reliable as a hand-scribbled note saying, "Heather is Covid Negative. She's clear to skip Quarantine. Thanks, Dr. Jones." Anyone can produce either.

I would screenshot confirmation pages for records. I advised people to do the same before. Now I am not so sure.

More technology will be easily available in the next decade. Perhaps I can make a movie of me doing a backflip. And if I can post myself doing it online, why bother to learn it in real life? Or would we evolve to distrust anything we see online?
