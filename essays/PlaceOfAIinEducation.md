### I. Introduction 
 
My intial exposure to AI took place last year, when I consulted chatGPT for my Physics homeowork problems. I was intially impressed as chatGPT explained step by step on how it calculated the magnetic filed change of a rotating motor. However, I was quickly dismayed when I realized all of its answers were incorrect. Furthermore, when I asked the questions again, it gave different answers. I was unimpressed, but fascinated on how it came to its wrong answers. 

This spring I took a course called Information and Computer Sciences 314: Software Engineering, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This course emphasizes hands on coding experience, culminating in a group project to develop a web application. ChatGPT has played a major role for me in this course, proving to be a reliable source of help. 


### II. Personal Expreience with AI 
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
   We were given on average of 3 take home WODs. Short for Workout Of the Day, we were to time how long it took to code certain tasks. I did not anticipate any need for AI, as my instructors provided us videos on the solutions. On one of the WODs, however, I could not make a functionality work. I froze the video multiple times to check where I have deviated. After a couple days I thought to ask chatGPT, which immediately found the (lack of) curly brackets needed.

2. In-class Practice WODs

3. In-class WODs
    In-class WODs were the most exciting, challenging and occasionally devastating part of this class. 100 points were awarded in a binary fashion: 100 for achieveing objectives on time, and 0 for anything else. I struggle doing anyhting- both academic and personal- tasks with speed. ChatGPT was accessible, and I would ask concise questions- for instance, on how to change a font of website I was building. I've never thought to ask it to write the whole code.
