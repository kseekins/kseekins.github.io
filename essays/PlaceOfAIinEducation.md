### I. Introduction 
 
My intial exposure to AI took place last year, when I consulted chatGPT for my Physics homeowork problems. I was intially impressed as chatGPT explained step by step on how it calculated the magnetic filed change of a rotating motor. However, I was quickly dismayed when I realized all of its answers were incorrect. Furthermore, when I asked the questions again, it gave different answers. I was unimpressed, but fascinated on how it came to its wrong answers. 

This spring I took a course called Information and Computer Sciences 314: Software Engineering, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This course emphasizes hands on coding experience, culminating in a group project to develop a web application. ChatGPT has played a major role for me in this course, proving to be a reliable source of help. 


### II. Personal Expreience with AI 
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
   We were given on average of 3 take home WODs. Short for Workout Of the Day, we were to time how long it took to code certain tasks. I did not anticipate any need for AI, as my instructors provided us videos on the solutions. On one of the WODs, however, I could not make a functionality work. I froze the video multiple times to check where I have deviated. After a couple days I thought to ask chatGPT, which immediately found the (lack of) curly brackets needed.

2. In-class Practice WODs 
    In-class Practice WODs were ungraded coding assignements. It served as a mock exam for the weekly WOD. For that reason I did not use AI. I wanted to see where and how I would stumble, so I could better prepare for the WOD. 
3. In-class WODs
    In-class WODs were the most exciting, challenging and occasionally devastating part of this class. 100 points were awarded in a binary fashion: 100 for achieveing objectives on time, and 0 for anything else. I struggle doing anyhting- both academic and personal- tasks with speed. ChatGPT was accessible, and I would ask concise questions- for instance, on how to change a font of website I was building. I've never thought to ask it to write the whole code. 

  4. Essays
    ChatGpt was used to check my spelling and rephrase sentences. Clearly, I could not ask chatGpt to reflect on my experiences. I was mindful in minimizing chatGpt even for editing purposes. It's tone is rational and balanced, but lacks any character in my experience.

  5. Final project
     I've had a couple of roadblocks in coding for Toaster-Eats, a web application for health and budget minded students. One of them involved creating an additional role for vendors. I opted to watch my instructor's video in  this topic, and wrote codes in two files to create the role. It did not work, and asking chatGpt was a dead end in this case. I looked for meteor documentation on  roles, but still could not diagnose the problem. It had turned out that I needed to code in one additional file. 
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
      Learning to code invovled more doing, and less attempts to conceptually understand what is coded. I would often have brod strokes ideas on what I'm coding. For ICS 314, the concepts we had to learn- such as how git works and how mongo is used- were explained well enough by our instructors. Therefore, I did not seek AI help. 
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
      I did not attempt to answer any questions I did not know. I did not see any point in using chatGpt to answer a question, as they could do that themselves. I've pointed someone to a potential issue for the tic-tac-toe extra credit project. I had coded that before and thought the he might be repeating the same error. 
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
      

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

### AI Use in this Piece

ChatGPT was only used to check spelling and grammar.
