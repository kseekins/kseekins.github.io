## I. Introduction 
 
My intial exposure to AI took place last year, when I consulted chatGPT for my Physics homeowork problems. I was intially impressed as chatGPT explained step by step on how it calculated the magnetic filed change of a rotating motor. However, I was quickly dismayed when I realized all of its answers were incorrect. Furthermore, when I asked the questions again, it gave different answers. I was unimpressed, but fascinated on how it came to its wrong answers. 

This spring I took a course called Information and Computer Sciences 314: Software Engineering, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This course emphasizes hands on coding experience, culminating in a group project to develop a web application. ChatGPT has played a major role for me in this course, proving to be a reliable source of help. 


## II. My Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs
   We were given on average of 3 take home WODs. Short for Workout Of the Day, we were to time how long it took to code certain tasks. I did not anticipate any need for AI, as my instructors provided us videos on the solutions. On one of the WODs, however, I could not make a functionality work. I froze the video multiple times to check where I have deviated. After a couple days I thought to ask chatGPT, which found the curly brackets I was missing:

## I have no clue...would design patterns give me any?

Without design patterns, my first instict would be to find a code that acomplishes a similar task. I would then modify it. This is arguably not an original work of code. For a newbie programmer to advance in programming, he might need to solve this problem from the ground up. I'll attempt to solve this problem by proposing which patterns to consider in solving this problem. 

2. In class Pratice WODs

3. In class WODs
    In-class WODs were the most exciting, challenging and occasionally devastating part of this class. 100 points were awarded in a binary fashion: 100 for achieveing objectives on time, and 0 for anything else. I struggle doing anyhting- both academic and personal- tasks with speed. ChatGPT was accessible, and I would ask concise questions- for instance, on how to change a font of website I was building. I've never thought to ask it to write the whole code. 

## The obvious ones

Some deisgn patterns may present themselves as obvious ingredients of the solution. First are the behvior patterns of observer and iterator. Everytime an entry for the price and location of an ingredient is inputted, we need that and all previous entries to be visible to the users. Observer is the concept of subscription- where an update listed is always published. The iterator concept would then comb through the updated list, and display relevant information. 

## Fuller Pciture 

These give us a game plan to execute a required task. We could embed a filed to submit a price tag, with information on where and how much. That price tag is added to the collection of price tag. To display all the price tags, we publish the list, and an iterator displays desired fields of "price" and "location". 

## AI Use in this Piece

ChatGPT was only used to check spelling and grammar.
