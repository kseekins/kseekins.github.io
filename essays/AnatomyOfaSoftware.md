## What I had Imagined 

This webpage "Shops Near Campus" looks simple enough. It resembles a Post-it notes stuck on a board. Prior to learning Software engineering, I would have imagined a single page of codes behind this page. 


<img width="700px" height ="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="./ListShops.jpg">


## So Many Directories and Subdirectories 

My assumption was correct to an extent- ListShops.jsx, shown just below the webpage does code for the page. However this file alone is not enough. To the left, we see a list of directories, subdirectories and files. This looked nothing but overwhelming for most of my semester. After 10 weeks in of staring at them, I've started to appreciate them. The organization made sense, and started to help my coding process. 

## Translating Real world into Code 

In the real world, replicating "Shops Near Campus" is much easier. I would find a large board.  We would write and draw the information of the stores on post-its. However,there is a significant feature the code version affords; when any user adds a shop, this change is reflected to all users viewing this page. 
  ```
  const subscription = Meteor.subscribe(Shops.userPublications);
  ```
