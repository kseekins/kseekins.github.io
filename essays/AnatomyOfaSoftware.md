## What I had Imagined 

This webpage "Shops Near Campus" looks simple enough. It resembles a Post-it notes stuck on a board. Prior to learning Software engineering, I would have imagined a single file of codes behind this page.

## What is Real?

Having firsthand experience with a UI framework teaches us about professional-looking websites. That image of the Hawaii Travel Website is as reliable as a hand-scribbled note saying, "Heather is Covid Negative. She's clear to skip Quarantine. Thanks, Dr. Jones." Anyone can produce either. Before learning UI frameworks, I knew "theoretically" that anyone could write a nice webpage. But on an emotional level, I still trusted clean, sleek-looking websites. I would screenshot confirmation pages for records. I advised people to do the same before. Now I am not so sure.

## I Feel Old

I'm a 38-year-old returning college student. When I first went to college in 2004, I did not have a cellphone. I handwrote my college applications, then mailed them via FedEx. Over the years, I was impressed by how everything—job applications, school applications, taxes—shifted online. Learning a UI framework feels like another leap of technology to me. More technology will be easily available in the next decade. Perhaps I can make a movie of me doing a backflip. And if I can post myself doing it online, why bother to learn it in real life? Or would we evolve to distrust anything we see online?
