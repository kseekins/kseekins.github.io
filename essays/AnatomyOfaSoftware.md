## What I had Imagined 

This webpage "Shops Near Campus" looks simple enough. It resembles a Post-it notes stuck on a board. Prior to learning Software engineering, I would have imagined a single page of codes behind this page.

## So Many Directories and Subdirectories 

My assumption was correct to an extent- ListShops.jsx, shown just below the webpage does code for the page. However this file alone is not enough. 

## I Feel Old

I'm a 38-year-old returning college student. When I first went to college in 2004, I did not have a cellphone. I handwrote my college applications, then mailed them via FedEx. Over the years, I was impressed by how everything—job applications, school applications, taxes—shifted online. Learning a UI framework feels like another leap of technology to me. More technology will be easily available in the next decade. Perhaps I can make a movie of me doing a backflip. And if I can post myself doing it online, why bother to learn it in real life? Or would we evolve to distrust anything we see online?
