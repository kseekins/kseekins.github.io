## Studying Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa 

Information and Computer Sceince (ICS) majors at University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) are taught Java in the beginning. We are then introduced to Javascript. I've always wondered why it was so. I wished that they would teach Python instead of Java, since much of the machine learning research uses Python. So far, I finshied the 3rd week of ICS 314: Software Engineering. It has focued on Javascript so far. Now I suspect that we were taught Java first to highlight the differences programming languages can have. 

## Protptypical Object Creation and Mitosis  

One of the differnces between Java and Javascript is how object is created. In Javascript, objects are created from other objects. Analogy used in our class was mitosis. All the cells in our body are created from cell division. We focus on mitosis for simplicity, as meiosis involves 2 succesive divisions and gene recombination. Just like a daugher cell receiving the same DNA as the mother cell, objects created from a previously existing object (the prototype)  inherits all its methods. 

## Exhibit Smart 

In stackoverflow, I looked for posts tagged with Javascript with highest score- indicating high approval from users, who can wither downvote or upvote a post. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/208105/how-do-i-remove-a-property-from-a-javascript-object) was one of them: short, sweet and to the point. They ask:


Given an object:

```javascript
let myObject = {
  "ircEvent": "PRIVMSG",
  "method": "newURI",
  "regex": "^http://.*"
};
```
How do I remove the property regex to end up with the following myObject?
```javascript
let myObject = {
  "ircEvent": "PRIVMSG",
  "method": "newURI"
};
```
To be fair, this question could be too simple such that googling or chatGPT is more suitable. However, there is no ambiguity about what the inquirer needs. It does not presume a particular solution either. The community has come up with multiple answers that can satisfy their requirements. 



## Final Note of Studying ICS at UHM

ICS 314: Software Engineering is a required course for ICS majors at UHM. The class does not revolve around exams, but weekly WODs: an in class timed programming assignment. Professor Johnson has compared it to Project Runway. It is a reality TV show of budding fashion designers who are given curve ball assignemnets to create garments in a time crunch. I appreciated him comparing this course to my favorite TV show. It has made me realize that being a student is all about optimizing the scarce time we have.
