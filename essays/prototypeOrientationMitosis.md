## Studying Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa 

Information and Computer Sceince (ICS) majors at University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) are taught Java in the beginning. We are then introduced to Javascript. I've always wondered why it was so. I wished that they would teach Python instead of Java, since much of the machine learning research uses Python. So far, I finshied the 3rd week of ICS 314: Software Engineering. It has focued on Javascript so far. Now I suspect that we were taught Java first to highlight the differences programming languages can have. 

## Tangled yarnball 

Courtesy is important to me. I joke that even though I'm not fully Japanese, I'm more Japanese than most Japanese by being sometimes overly polite.  That has helped me in hotels and patient care. The  downside is that I could assume others value courtesy as much as I do.  Jeff Bigler's [tact filters](https://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html) was enlightening as it never occured that "tact" could be applied in the incoming direction. It's acutally quite ingenious- theoretically no words could bother you when you add "...but they really didn't mean that".  Once in a Java class, I had a classmate review my Pokemon code as "a big tangled yarn ball- you need to straighten this put". Thinking of it now, it's funny and it makes sense. At the time, I was livid. 

## Exhibit Smart 

In stackoverflow, I looked for posts tagged with Javascript with highest score- indicating high approval from users, who can wither downvote or upvote a post. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/208105/how-do-i-remove-a-property-from-a-javascript-object) was one of them: short, sweet and to the point. They ask:


Given an object:

```javascript
let myObject = {
  "ircEvent": "PRIVMSG",
  "method": "newURI",
  "regex": "^http://.*"
};
```
How do I remove the property regex to end up with the following myObject?
```javascript
let myObject = {
  "ircEvent": "PRIVMSG",
  "method": "newURI"
};
```
To be fair, this question could be too simple such that googling or chatGPT is more suitable. However, there is no ambiguity about what the inquirer needs. It does not presume a particular solution either. The community has come up with multiple answers that can satisfy their requirements. 



## Final Note of Studying ICS at UHM

ICS 314: Software Engineering is a required course for ICS majors at UHM. The class does not revolve around exams, but weekly WODs: an in class timed programming assignment. Professor Johnson has compared it to Project Runway. It is a reality TV show of budding fashion designers who are given curve ball assignemnets to create garments in a time crunch. I appreciated him comparing this course to my favorite TV show. It has made me realize that being a student is all about optimizing the scarce time we have.
