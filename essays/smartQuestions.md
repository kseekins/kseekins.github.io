## Respect My Time

In [How to Ask Questions The Smart by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), there is a recurring theme of time.  A question can reflect whether the inquirer values of the time of the community. When asking a question, we can take steps to aim for the least amount of hassle to answer it. When I worked in the hotel industry, I read a book about the service culture at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. One of the bellman interviewed said his philosophy was to anticipate and remove any forseeable hassles that guests might face. I feel this is a good instinct to have.

Courtesy is important to me. I joke that even though I'm not fully Japanese, I'm more Japanese than most Japanese by being sometimes overly polite.  That has helped me in hotels and patient care. The  downside is that I could assume others value courtesy as much as I do.  Jeff Bigler's [tact filters](https://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html) was enlightening as it never occured that "tact" could be applied in the incoming direction. It's acutally quite ingenious- theoretically no words could bother you when you add "...but they really didn't mean that".  Once in a Java class, I had a classmate review my Pokemon code as "a big tangled yarn ball- you need to straighten this put". Thinking of it now, it's funny and it makes sense. At the time, I was livid.
